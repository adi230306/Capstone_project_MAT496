Template for creating and submitting MAT496 capstone project.

# Overview of MAT496

In this course, we have primarily learned Langgraph. This is helpful tool to build apps which can process unstructured `text`, find information we are looking for, and present the format we choose. Some specific topics we have covered are:

- Prompting
- Structured Output 
- Semantic Search
- Retreaval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Tool calling LLMs & MCP
- Langgraph: State, Nodes, Graph

We also learned that Langsmith is a nice tool for debugging Langgraph codes.

# Capstone Project objective

The first purpose of the capstone project is to give a chance to revise all the major above listed topics. The second purpose of the capstone is to show your creativity. Think about all the problems which you can not have solved earlier, but are not possible to solve with the concepts learned in this course. For example, We can use LLM to analyse all kinds of news: sports news, financial news, political news. Another example, we can use LLMs to build a legal assistant. Pretty much anything which requires lots of reading, can be outsourced to LLMs. Let your imagination run free.

# Project report Template

## Title: [your title goes here]

## Overview

[your overview goes here. My project does this that  etc]

## Reason for picking up this project

Explain how this project is aligned with this course content.

## Video Summary Link: 

Make a short -  3-5 min video of yourself, put it on youtube/googledrive, and put its link in your README.md.

- you can use this free tool for recording https://screenrec.com/
- Video format should be like this:
- your face should be visible
- State the overall job of your agent: what inputs it takes, and what output it gives.
- Very quickly, explain how your agent acts on the input and spits out the output. 
- show an example run of the agent in the video


## Plan

I plan to execute these steps to complete my project.

- [DONE] Setting up the project structure and defining the state schema
- [DONE] Implement the search node with Tavily tool integration
- [DONE] Build retrieval and parsing node for content extraction
- [TODO] Step 4 involves creating the research agent node with multi-perspective analysis
- [TODO] Step 5 involves implementing the outline generation node with structured output
- [TODO] Step 6 involves building the drafting node for section-wise content creation
- [TODO] Step 7 involves creating the synthesis node for coherent article assembly
- [TODO] Step 8 involves adding the refinement node for quality assurance
- [TODO] Step 9 involves testing the complete workflow with various topics
- [TODO] Step 10 involves documentation and final project submission

## Conclusion:

I had planned to achieve {this this}. I think I have/have-not achieved the conclusion satisfactorily. The reason for your satisfaction/unsatisfaction.

# Added instructions:

- This is a `solo assignment`. Each of you will work alone. You are free to talk, discuss with chatgpt, but you are responsible for what you submit. Some students may be called for viva. You should be able to each and every line of work submitted by you.

- `commit` History maintenance.
  - Fork this repository and build on top of that.
  - For every step in your plan, there has to be a commit.
  - Change [TODO] to [DONE] in the plan, before you commit after that step. 
  - The commit history should show decent amount of work spread into minimum two dates. 
  - **All the commits done in one day will be rejected**. Even if you are capable of doing the whole thing in one day, refine it in two days.  
 
 - Deadline: Dec 2nd, Tuesday 11:59 pm
